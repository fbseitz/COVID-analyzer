# COVID-analyzer
COVID data analyzer for CS50 final project.

This was my first Python project, created as the final project for Harvard's CS50X Introduction to Computer Science class. Looking back on it now, there is alot that could be improved here, but I am proud of it as a first effort. It is a terminal program that pulled publicly available COVID data from the COVID Tracking Project, and was able to show table analysis and some basic graphs to display data based on a user-entered date range.
